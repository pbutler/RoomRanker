For 0.3.0:
* Remove mutable objects from default paramaters. See
  http://effbot.org/zone/default-values.htm
* Get a list of services from FriendFeed

For Consideration:
* The API allows getting user and room profiles by UUIDs. This should be
  supported by the library. It raises the question of making nicknames
  required attributes for User and Room.
* None of the classes have __hash__ support but do have __eq__ and __ne__
  support. This is considered a Python faux pas. The question is how to
  resolve this.

Wishlist:
* Add unit tests for calls to the API. (Currently all tests are internal.)
  - This requires mock tests?
* Add an optional means of limiting the rate at which calls to the
  FriendFeed API can be made.
  - See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/401215/how-to-limit-rate-of-requests-to-web-services-in-python
* Add realtime methods.
* Add logging via the standard library logging module.
